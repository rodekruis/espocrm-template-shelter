# People Affected Management (PAM)

## Introduction

**People Affected Management (PAM)** is a data management solution based on EspoCRM for humanitarian organizations to manage the data of the people they serve.

#### Why PAM?
Management of people's personal information is a critical aspect of humanitarian work. It is essential to have a system that is **secure**, **easy to use**, **fast to set up**, and **customizable** to the needs of your organization. PAM is designed to meet these requirements. It offers:
* A simple yet effective **data model**, defining what data is stored in the system and how it is interlinked​
* A set of **layouts** to easily manage this data​
* Standard **user roles** to control access, down to individual records and fields​
* **Workflows** that automate operational processes​
* **Integrations** with other tools, such as Kobo, PowerBI, or Twilio

#### Why EspoCRM?
[EspoCRM](https://www.espocrm.com/) is an open-source data management system. It is highly customizable, directly from the user interface. It is free to use, lightweight, and has a large, supportive user community. For more information, visit the [EspoCRM Documentation](https://docs.espocrm.com/) and [510's EspoCRM knowledge base](https://github.com/rodekruis/EspoCRM-knowledge-base/wiki).


## Description

PAM consists of _Entities_ and _Roles_. 
* Entities are data structures that hold information (about people, programs, etc.).
* Roles are sets of permissions that define what each user can do in the system.

#### Entities and their relationships:
* **Person Affected (PA)**: a person affected by a disaster, e.g. a beneficiary of a program. Linked to HHs, programs, and tasks.
* **Household (HH)**: a group of people living together, e.g. a family. Linked to one or more PAs.
* **Program**: a project or activity, e.g. a cash distribution. Linked to one or more PAs.
* **Task**: an action to be taken, e.g. a follow-up phone call, that can be assigned to a user, e.g. a volunteer. Linked to one or more PAs.

#### Roles:
* **Volunteer**: registers PAs and HHs. Sees PAs and HHs of their team (e.g. a branch). Can be assigned tasks.
* **Volunteer Manager**: registers PAs and HHs. Sees and edit all PAs and HHs of their team (e.g. a branch). Can create and assign tasks to volunteers in their team.
* **Program Officer**: registers, sees, and edits all PAs and HHs. Can create and assign tasks.
* **Program Manager**: registers, sees, and edits all PAs and HHs. Can create and assign tasks. Can create and edit programs.
* **Movement Partner or Higher Management**: Sees all data except personally identifiable information (PII).
